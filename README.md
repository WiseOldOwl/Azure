# Landing Zone Deployment with Terraform and Azure DevOps

This repository showcases my skills in **Terraform** and **Azure DevOps** (ADO) by automating the deployment of an Azure Landing Zone. Initially, this project deployed ARM templates via an ADO release pipeline, but I've enhanced it by transitioning to **Terraform** with a **YAML-based CI/CD pipeline**.
